# Challenge Exercise: The Game Strategy Helper

_written by: Shane Emmons_

I like to play games, but I'm a moderate strategist at best. When I'm
sitting at the game table, I often come up blank trying to think
more than one or two moves ahead. That's where you come in. For this
exercise you will build a Game Strategy Helper which does the heavy
lifting of thinking several moves ahead.

## Examples

- Chess best move. Given the current state of the board which move can I
make that has the most potential for a checkmate in the next `n` moves.
- Axis & Allies Dead Zones. Given I attack a position with units x, y, z.
What is the statistical outcome of that fight, and given the current
enemy positions what is the likelihood that I'll hold that position after
I take it.

## Exercise Summary

- Choose a game.
  - Students may not work on the same game.
  - The game should be complex enough that a beginner cannot work out your
    proposed strategy.
- Implement the Strategy Helper for your chosen game.
